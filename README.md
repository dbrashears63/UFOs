## Project Overview
The purpose of the project is to use JavaScript and HTML to display UFO sighting data as a table and allow users to filter through this data using multiple criteria. A table was built using data stored in a JavaScript array. Filters were created so users could input data to display desired data. 


## Coding Resources and Goals 
### Resources: 

* UFO starter code files
* Java Script
* HTML
* CSS
* Bootstrap

### Goals: 

* Use HTML to build the webpage, CSS to style the page, and JavaScript to make the page interactive
* Use JavaScript to add interactive behaviors for the table
* Convert the data.js file which houses an array of UFO data into a usable table
* Create a table that may be filtered by multiple criteria
