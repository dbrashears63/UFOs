# UFOâ€™s The Truth Is Out There

## Project Overview
The purpose of the project is to use JavaScript and HTML to display UFO sighting data as a table and allow users to filter through this data using multiple criteria. A table was built using data stored in a JavaScript array. Filters were created so users could input data to display desired data.
