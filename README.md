## Project Overview
The purpose of the project is to use JavaScript and HTML to display UFO sighting data as a table and allow users to filter through this data using multiple criteria. A table was built using data stored in a JavaScript array. Filters were created so users could input data to display desired data. 


## Coding Resources and Goals 
### Resources: 

* UFO starter code files
* Java Script
* HTML
* CSS
* Bootstrap

### Goals: 

* Use HTML to build the webpage, CSS to style the page, and JavaScript to make the page interactive
* Use JavaScript to add interactive behaviors for the table
* Convert the data.js file which houses an array of UFO data into a usable table
* Create a table that may be filtered by multiple criteria



## Results

When users view the webpage, they can filter the UFO data by various criteria. This includes the date the UFO sighting occurred, the city, state, country it occurred in and a shape. The user would input the desired information in any field and then click enter and the table automatically updates to display the filtered data. 
page and the data is filtered on that information. 

For example:
Date: leave defalut data

City: willow

State: ak

Country: leave default data

Shape: leave default data
